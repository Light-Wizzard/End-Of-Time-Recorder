# End-Of-Time-Recorder
End Of Time Recorder based on Sir Isaac Newton's 2060 Date
## End of Time Recorder
The History of the End of Time is found in the Bible, but is not about Religion, and I am not Religious, nor was Kepler, Newton or Tesla, yet they all wrote about the End of Time, and Newton proved God is All Light without Darkness, and Tesla proved that is Light inside of every Atom, so God is the Light inside of Atoms, and also the Force of Gravity in all their Math Equations, so I know I am not supposed to talk about Religion so I will not, nor will I talk about the Bible, I will only talk about what Kepler, Newton and Tesla wrote about the End of Time. Johannes Kepler went looking for the Birthday of Jesus Christ, only to find a 3rd Century Bible that did not have Christ in it, and found out Christ is actually the name of a Star, and Christianity is the Study of Stars, but that was only one thing he found strange about this version of the Bible or Torah, but the fact it states the End of Time can be calculated, and Sir Isaac Newton did just that in 1666, and calculated the date to be 25 December 2060 under the Julian Calendar, 42 (in Hex 42 = 66 in Decimal) years before the year 2102, and as that time nears, so does the possibility of the Earth Shifting its Magnetic Polarity, and collapsing our Magnetosphere, venting our Atmosphere into Space, and in the instant Ice Age, the End of Time.
I have verified Newton’s calculation and want to know how to record it, using a PI and Arduino and the use of a Magnetometer, like these below. 
The concept is simple enough, you make a mechanical housing that holds these parts, and can be manually aligned to Magnetic North, and True North, and can find its position in real-time, and being able to sense that the mechanical position is not right, a shift must have occurred, and to record it.
It also needs to calculate the rate at which our Magnetic Field is weakening, according to Newton, who studied ship magnetic reading logs from around the world starting in the year 999, he calculated it will be gone by the year 2102, under the Julian Calendar, most people use the Gregorian Calendar, and this event is calculated to happen on 14 January 2061, and is already in progress, so it only needs to record the strength, and calculate this date, based on its readings.
What I need help with is finding the most sensitive Magnetometer for this usage, one that can detect Magnetic North, but calculate the rate at which our Magnetic Field or Magnetosphere is fluctuating, and to deal with natural magnetic lines of deviation, and be able to plot changes in real-time.
I am 60 years old, Medically Retired United States Air Force Computer Station (E)F-111, I have a Medal for improving that Aircraft by 30%, mainly due to Electronic improvements, and computer programming, after the Gulf War in 1991, my health started to go downhill due to Gulf War Syndrome, which in my case is caused by DNA damage due to Chemical Warfare, I have cancer, after having flesh around my spine removed over the years, and having my descending colon and gallbladder removed, I started to focus on what Nikola Tesla wrote about, and looked at our Earth as being an Electromagnetic Engine, I call the Trinary Engine, and I wrote a book called “The Principles of the Trinary Universe”, you can find out about his book here http://LightWizzard.com/references.html#reference_jeffrey_scott_flesher, and you can download the PDF for free, or buy the ePub or printed book, but it is free to download and read online, and it explains this in great detail, so I will not repeat it here, the book is 666 pages, written like a Text Book, but explains this is Real Science, and I have an IQ over 180, ASVAB scores of 99% for Electrical and Mechanical, so I understand how Retarded Einstein was for believing Light is Dynamic, knowing it has no acceleration, therefore static like Kepler, Newton and Tesla said, so my Science has no Theory, it is only based on Facts, and it is a fact the World is about to go into an Ice Age, and this means the End of Time, our Magnetosphere is a Magnetic Generator, and when that field reverses polarity, it will collapse, venting our Atmosphere into Space for the time period it take to start up in the new direction, and I want to be able to record the time the field is collapsed, as well as its new location. For those that cannot hold their breath that long, which will be over 90% of all lifeforms living on the surface of this Planet, this will be the End of Time, and if you believe in Einstein you are retarded, a Theory is not a fact nor a way of explaining one, Einstein only had a Theory about an Alternate Reality in an Alternate Universe, and has nothing to do with our own Universe, unless you can prove Light without Darkness is inside of every atom in the Universe, since that is what God is, and anyone that tells you this is not going to happen is a liar since it is in progress now, and you know why, our Magnetic force field has be weakening since the year 999, and will be gone by 2103, and that is called Science that can be verified, and I want to build a machine that can record this event. You can be my guess to disagree with me, but base it on facts, and once you investigate this fact, you cannot disagree with it. Countries are building Underground Cities for the Rich and Famous, and the Military knows why, the reason few others know, is simple, they do not have tickets to live in these Underground death traps, that will not survive the Earthquakes, due to the lack of Oil that acts as a lubricant to make the Earth go around, and an Electrical and Heat Conductor, and that is why our Earth is quaking, and acting all crazy, it is wobbling due to the lack of Oil to keep our planet on an even spin, so when the field drops, our planet will begin to grind very violently, so the Oil Companies lies about what Oil is, just to make a buck, not caring about the End of Time, I will be 100 years old on this Calculated End of Time calculation everyone knows about, since it is my 100 birthday, and my name is Flesh, and I know this will happen for a fact, based on facts, and want to build a machine to prove it, and not wonder why this fake Pandemic is all about, hiding the fact that the US is owned by a Privately owned Bank, and has no Constitution, therefore no Legal President, since by Law it is just a Franchise for the Federal Reserve that owns US like Sheep, and US is actually the Dollar Sign ($ two bars instead of one) if you superimpose the letters on top of each other, so this is a Fake Country, like all the Others owned by the Bank, that does not want its Slaves to know this, but Military Dogs like me do not care about Lies, only what we can prove is a fact, and the End of Time is just a Fact.
I am thinking the Arduino Uno or Mega would be a good choice for a board
